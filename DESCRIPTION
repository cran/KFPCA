Description: Implementation for Kendall functional principal component analysis. Kendall functional principal component analysis is a robust functional principal component analysis technique for non-Gaussian functional/longitudinal data. The crucial function of this package is KFPCA(). Moreover, least square estimates of functional principal component scores are also provided. Refer to <arXiv:2102.00911>.
